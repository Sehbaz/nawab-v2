                first attemp. All because of Mr. Navab my instructor, who was
                very calm and patient and made my driving so easy and enjoyable.
                He always make sure tht his student pass the test in first go.
                Very punctual on time and flexible with your time as well.
                Highly recommended to all new learners.Honestly couldn't ask for
                better instructor than him.

                to improve on, as well as going over other things to refresh my
                skills. He works around your life and always organised. I highly
