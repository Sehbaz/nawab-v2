                Hurrey…. ! I just passed my driving practical test today in
                first attemp. All because of Mr. Navab my instructor, who was
                very calm and patient and made my driving so easy and enjoyable.
                He always make sure tht his student pass the test in first go.
                Very punctual on time and flexible with your time as well.
                Highly recommended to all new learners.Honestly couldn't ask for
                better instructor than him.

                Nawab is a brilliant instructor, very patient, positive and
                supportive through out the lessons. He focused on areas I needed
                to improve on, as well as going over other things to refresh my
                skills. He works around your life and always organised. I highly
                recommend Nawab school of driving.

                I PASSED ON THE FIRST GO. This is all because of Nawab. He is an
                excellent teacher. He knows how to teach and what to teach. I
                would highly recommend to go Nawab.

                Honestly couldn't have asked for a better driving instructors.
                He made me feel so confident before the test even though I
                doubted myself he assured me and helped me out alot with the
                things I wasn't sure about. I would definitely recommend him for
                anyone as I had the most incredible experience with him.

                I had a pleasant experience with Mr Nawab passing my test on the
                first attempt after a month of lessons. His calm demeanour and
                constructive feedback was a huge help in allowing me to learn to
                drive. I would definitely recommend him to others who are
                looking to pursue driving lessons.

                Passed first time with zero faults!! Brilliant instructor very
                professional would highly recommend! I was very anxious and
                thought I’d never pass at the beginning this instructor tailored
                his teaching to make me confident and less anxious about driving
                now I’m very confident behind the wheel and the test proved
                that! I’m very thankful
